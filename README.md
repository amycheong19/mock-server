## Descriptions

ðŸ˜Ž The mock server project demo from [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). A project acts as a router for server as a endpoint for the same port, thus each project has their own custom routes for separation purpose.

Added in [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to populate random data as convenience.
